3.	LICENSE GRANT:

A.	Subject to your timely payment of the license fees, if any, and compliance with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel grants to you a non-exclusive, non-assignable license under its copyrights in the Materials to:

(i)	internally reproduce and install a reasonable number of copies of the Materials for your internal use solely for the Purpose and in accordance with the documentation included as in the Materials.

(ii)	create derivative works of the Redistributables, or any portions thereof, that are defined as Source Code solely for the Purpose.

(iii)	distribute (or otherwise make available) on a royalty-free basis, subject to any other terms and conditions which may appear in the Redistributables text files, the Redistributables, including any derivative works pursuant to Section 2(A)(ii), or any portions thereof, only as integrated or embedded in an Application (and not on a stand-alone basis). You may grant your customers the right to further distribute those Redistributables solely as integrated or embedded in Your Application.  HOWEVER, IF YOU RECEIVED THE MATERIALS FOR THE PURPOSES OF EVALUATION, YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS TO DISTRIBUTE THE MATERIALS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE REDISTRIBUTABLES OR ANY PORTIONS THEREOF AND THE AFOREMENTIONED DERIVATIVE WORKS. 

B.	Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel grants to you a non-exclusive, non-assignable license under Intel's Licensed Patent Claims, to: (i) make copies of the Materials internally only; (ii) use the Materials internally only; (ii) offer to distribute and distribute, but not sell, the Redistributables under the license under Intel's copyrights granted in Section 3(A)(ii), but only under the terms of that copyright license and not as a sale;

C.	An essential basis of the bargain in this Agreement is that no licenses or other rights, including but not limited to patent, trade secret, and copyright licenses or rights, are granted to you by implication, estoppel or otherwise, except for the licenses expressly granted in Section 3A and 3B. The consideration provided under this Agreement is only for the licenses expressly granted to you in this Agreement. Any other rights, including but not limited to additional patent rights, would require an additional license and additional consideration. Nothing in this Agreement requires or will be treated to require Intel to grant any additional license. You acknowledge that there are significant uses of the Materials, or implementations of the Materials, in their original, unmodified, and uncombined form. Specifically, Intel expressly does not grant you a patent license in this Agreement to any modifications of or derivative works of the Materials, whether made by you, your contractor, your customer, or any other third party in creating the derivative works even to the extent creation of derivative works is permitted under 3(A)(ii). The consideration for the license in this Agreement reflects Intel's continuing right to assert patent claims against any modifications or derivative works (including, without limitation, error corrections and bug fixes) of, or combinations with, the Materials or implementations of the Materials that infringe any Intel patent claim that is not a Licensed Patent Claim.
